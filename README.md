# planMyRoute: A tool for finding the best route for delivery

Delivery companies always use this type of tools for efficient delivery plans. Here, we have created a tool for efficiently planning the route for delivering automative batteries, where the source of delivery is our battery shop - Debnath Auto Centre, Kolkata. We have some dealers in Kolkata where we deliver automotive batteries in a frequent manner. The issue we are facing right now is that we don't have a proper delivery schedule. Batteries are currently delivered in a scattered manner, which causes much hassle for the delivery guys. Not to mention the excessive usage of fuel. A tool like this can be useful to overcome the aforementioned challenges.
