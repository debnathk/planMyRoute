# Updates:
05/18 - A working model is running with minimal UI, shortest path is not bein calcualted for optimal routing

# TODO:
Implement TSP to calculate optimal routing.

# Custom Map Tool

This project is an interactive custom map web tool that calculates the best route to visit a set of locations and return to the origin using Google Maps API.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your actual Google Maps API key.

## Usage

1. Enter the origin address in the "Enter origin" input field.
2. Enter the addresses of locations to visit, one per line, in the "Enter locations" text area.
3. Click the "Calculate Route" button to see the optimal route on the map.

Implementation plan for v1.0:
- Start with random 10 addresses, and our shop as source.
- Convert addresses to locations
- Calculate shortest route by solving TSP
- Sort the list of destinations as per the route
- Put the sorted destinations onto Google Maps, generate the path line, with estimated time
- Done!

Intuition for v2.0:
- Consider the real-time traffic impact
